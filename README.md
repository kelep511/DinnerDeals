# Dinner Deals

Dinner Deals is a Recipe sharing site. Users can create recipes, share them, and favorite other users recipes.
Dinner Deals was built in mind with being able to take the ingredients in a recipe and creating a shopping list that included the exact location of the items in the users selected grocery store. (this function is currently inactive as access to the api is too expensive.)

## How to use

2a. If you've registered previously, you can log in with the top nav-bar
